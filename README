agendabot is an IRC 'bot that watches for lines of the form

    agenda: URL

and tries to extract a meeting agenda from the document at that URL.
If you say

    agendabot, find agenda

it will try to find the URL by itself.

It writes the agenda back to the IRC channel in a form understood by
Zakim[1].

The manual for how to run agendabot is included in the program: See
the source or run "perldoc agendabot.pl".

The manual for using it from within IRC is in manual.html.
