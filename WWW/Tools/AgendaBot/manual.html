<h1>agendabot</h1>

<p>agendabot is an IRC 'bot that gets a meeting agenda from a URL. It
is especially useful as a complement to
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html"
class="podlinkurl" >Zakim</a> meeting 'bot, but does not require it.


<h2>Use from IRC</h2>

<p>Assuming agendabot is connected to an IRC server (see the
documentation in the <a href="agendabot.pl"
>program</a> for how to run it), the steps to using it are as follows:

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>Invite the 'bot to the channel you are meeting on:

  <pre class=command>/invite agendabot</pre>

 <li>
  <p>Tell the 'bot where the agenda of your meeting is:

  <pre class=command>agenda: http://example.org/agendas/2018/13</pre>

  <p>You can also use a /me instruction:

  <pre class=command>/me agenda: http://example.org/agendas/2018/13</pre>

  <p>If agendabot succeeds in downloading and parsing the linked
  document, it will print the agenda to the IRC channel. That could
  look like, e.g.:

  <pre>clear agenda
agenda+ Welcome
agenda+ Winter topics
agenda+ AOB</pre>

 <li>
  <p>When the agendabot is no longer needed, dismiss it:

  <pre class=command>agendabot, bye</pre>
</ol>

<p>Agendabot also knows a help command (‘agendabot, help’) and replies
to it with some info about itself.

<p>The reload command (‘agendabot, reload’) asks agendabot to reread
the configuration files it was started with, if any.

<h3>Slow?</h3>

<p>Agendabot may appear to be slow. Occasionally that may be because
the Web server is slow to deliver the requested agenda, but most
likely you are seeing the so-called flood protection. The 'bot pauses
before every line, to avoid being kicked off the channel for sending
too much text in too short a time.

<p>Just be patient…

 
<h2>Agenda formats</h2>

<p>When given a URL, agendabot tries to retrieve the document at that
URL and scan it for text that looks like an agenda. Agendabot
currently recognizes agendas in one of the following forms. The
document may be plain text, XHTML, HTML or HTML5, or any text format
that is close to plain text.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In this format, agenda topics are lines that start with a number
and a period and are followed by a line starting with at least four
dashes. E.g.:

<pre class=command>1. Welcome
----------

2. The apple tree
----------

3. AOB
------</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre>clear agenda
agenda+ Welcome
agenda+ The apple tree
agenda+ AOB</pre>

<li>
<p>This format requires the text ‘=== AGENDA ===’ (upper- or lowercase
and possibly with more ‘=’ signs) to occur in the document. All agenda
topics are lines that start with ‘Topic:’;. E.g.:

<pre class=command>==== AGENDA ====

Topic: AOB?

Topic: Radar</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre>clear agenda
agenda+ AOB?
agenda+ Radar</pre>

<li>
<p>This format already uses Zakim's format, i.e., topics are lines
that start with "agenda+". E.g.:

<pre class=command>agenda+ Roundtable
agenda+ TPAC registration
agenda+ Next meeting</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre>clear agenda
agenda+ Roundtable
agenda+ TPAC registration
agenda+ Next meeting</pre>

<li>
<p>This format has the word "Agenda" somewhere in the text and topics
are lines that start with "1)", "1.", "*", "•", "◦" or "⁃". If there
are multiple markers in use, only the one with the smallest indent is
used. The others are assumed to mark subtopics.

<pre>Agenda telcon 20 July
0. Extra agenda items and other digressions
1. [css-display] Blockifications
   * Positioning
   * Syntax
2. [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre>clear agenda
agenda+ Extra agenda items and other digressions
agenda+ [css-display] Blockifications
agenda+ [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration</pre>

</ol>

<p>This was a 2018 Geek Week project. The idea for agendabot is due to
Richard Ishida.
