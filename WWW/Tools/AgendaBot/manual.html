    <h1>agendabot</h1>

    <p>agendabot is an IRC 'bot that gets a meeting agenda from a
      URL. It is especially useful as a complement to the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html"
      class="podlinkurl" >Zakim</a> meeting 'bot, but does not require
      it.

    <p>agendabot is currently an experimental service.

    <h2>Use from IRC</h2>

    <p>Assuming agendabot is connected to an IRC server (see the
      documentation in the <a href="agendabot.pl" >program</a> for how
      to run it), you can control it via commands that typically look
      like this:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, <var>command…</var>
agendabot, please, <var>command…</var>
/me agendabot, <var>command…</var></pre>

    <p>The commands are:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#invite">/invite &ndash; call agendabot to an IRC channel</a>
      <li><a href="#agenda">agenda: &ndash; read an agenda from a web page</a>
      <li><a href="#find">find &ndash; find an agenda in the mail archives</a>
      <li><a href="#">suggest &ndash; list the agenda topics that people suggested by mail</a>
      <li><a href="#accept">accept &ndash; turn the suggested topic into an agenda</a>
      <li><a href="#this-is">this is &ndash; associate a mailing list archive</a>
      <li><a href="#forget">forget &ndash; remove the mailing list archive</a>
      <li><a href="#status">status &ndash; display the associated list archive</a>
      <li><a href="#bye">bye &ndash; dismiss agendabot from an IRC channel</a>
      <li><a href="#help">help &ndash; consult agendabot's manual</a>
    </ul>

    <h3 id=invite>Invite agendabot</h3>

    <p>Invite the 'bot to the channel you are meeting on:

    <pre class=command>/invite agendabot</pre>

    <p>Note that this is a command to the IRC server, not to agendabot
      (which presumably isn't on the channel yet) and thus does not
      start with ‘agendabot,’.

    <h3 id=agenda>Load agenda</h3>

    <p>Tell the 'bot where the agenda of your meeting is:

    <pre class=command>agenda: http://example.org/agendas/2018/13</pre>

    <p>If agendabot succeeds in downloading and parsing the linked
      document, it will print the agenda to the IRC channel, with the
      syntax that the <a href="../../2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html"
      >Zakim</a> 'bot understands. That could look like, e.g.:

    <pre class=example>clear agenda
agenda+ Welcome
agenda+ Winter topics
agenda+ AOB</pre>

    <p>‘Agenda:’ is in fact a command for the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent" >RRSAgent</a> 'bot
      (which uses it to copy the URL into meeting minutes). That is
      why it does not start with ‘agendabot,’. To let agendabot look
      up the agenda while hiding the URL from RRSAgent, you can use a
      /me instruction or address agendabot directly:

    <pre class=command>/me agenda: http://example.org/agendas/2018/13
agendabot, agenda: http://example.org/agendas/2018/13</pre>

    <h3 id=find>Search for an agenda</h3>

    <p>Instead of pointing agendabot to a specific URL, you can also
      ask it go search for the URL by itself in the mailing list
      archives or the group calendars. The command is one of these, or
      similar:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, find agenda
agendabot, search for the agenda
agendabot, please, find the agenda.</pre>

    <p>Agendabot will search the calendar and the mail archive in the
      background (this
      may take several seconds) and then output something like this:

    <pre class=example>agenda: http://example.org/archive/foo/2109.html
clear agenda
agenda+ Welcome
agenda+ Winter topics
agenda+ AOB</pre>

    <p>unless it fails to find an agenda, in which case it will say
      so.

    <p>Agendabot normally searches back one week, but you can give an
      explicit number of days or weeks:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, find agenda since 3 weeks
agendabot, find agenda since 21 days
agendabot, find agenda in the last 21 days</pre>

    <p>This assumes agendabot already knows which mailing list archive
      to search in. See <a href="#this-is" >‘Associate a mailing list
      archive or calendar’</a> below.

    <h3 id=suggest>Propose an agenda</h3>

    <p>Agendabot can also look for agenda topics that people suggested
      on the mailing list and propose an agenda. It looks for mail
      messages with a subject of ‘agenda+ …some topic…’. To ask
      agendabot to suggest an agenda, say:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, suggest agenda
agendabot, propose an agenda.</pre>

    <p>The result might be like this:

    <pre class=example>I found 2 topics:
1) ftf agenda
2) discuss issue 27</pre>

    <p>Agendabot will report the topics it found, but not make an
      agenda in Zakim's format yet. To do that, see the next command,
      <a href="#accept" >‘accept’</a>.

    <p>Agendabot will search for topics in messages on the mailing
      list in the last seven days. To search back over a different
      period, add a number of days or weeks:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, please suggest an agenda since 2 weeks.
agendabot, suggest an agenda since 14 days
agendabot, suggest an agenda last 14 days</pre>

    <p>or just:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, since 14 days</pre>

    <p>Like for the <a href="#find" >‘find’</a> command, this assumes
      agendabot knows in which mailing list to search. See <a
      href="#this-is" >‘Associate a mailing list archive or
      calendar’</a> below.

    <h3 id=accept>Accept a proposed agenda</h3>

    <p>To accept the agenda topics that agendabot suggested after a <a
      href="#suggest" >‘suggest’</a> command and turn them into an
      agenda in the format that Zakim accepts, say:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, accept
agendabot, confirm agenda
agendabot, make this agenda</pre>

    <p>You must accept an agenda <em>within one hour</em> after agendabot
      suggested it.

    <h3 id=this-is>Associate a mailing list archive or calendar</h3>

    <p>To tell agendabot in which mailing list archive or calendar to
      search, use a command like the following. Agendabot will
      remember the mailing list and calendar, even when it leaves the
      channel. More than one mailing list and calendar is also
      possible: Separate them with commas or the word ‘and’. (But the
      current version 0.4 of agendabot isn't smart and may give up
      even before reaching the second list.)

    <pre class=command>agendabot, this is abcd
agendabot, this is https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-abcd/
agendabot, this is https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/abcd/calendar
agendabot, this abcd, efgh and ijkl</pre>

    <p>The short form makes agendabot try the following calendars and
      archives:

    <ul>
      <li>https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/abcd
      <li>https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/abcd
      <li>https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/abcd
      <li>https://www.w3.org/groups/bg/abcd
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/team-abcd/
      <li>https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-abcd/
    </ul>

    <p>Agendabot will skip any that do not exist and will only search
      password-protected archives if the current
      channel is a team-only channel or if agendabot's configuration
      contains an exception for the current channel.

    <h3 id=forget>Remove a mailing list or calendar</h3>

    <p>If you want agendabot to forget the mailing list(s) associated
      with this channel, say something like:

<pre class=command>agendabot, forget mailing list
agendabot, please, forget the mailing list
agendabot, forget the list</pre>

    <p>Plural ‘lists’ works, too.

    <p>To tell agendabot to forget the calendar(s), say something like

    <pre class=command>agendabot, forget calendar
agendabot, please, forget the calendar</pre>

    <p>Plural ‘calendars’ works, too.

    <p>To forget calendars and lists in one go, use ‘all’, e.g.:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, forget all
agendabot, please, forget all</pre>

    <h3 id=status>Display the mailing list and calendar</h3>

    <p>To ask agendabot what mailing list(s) and calendar(s) it has
      associated with
      this channel, say:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, status?
agendabot, info?</pre>

    <h3 id=bye>Dismiss agendabot</h3>

    <p>If you want agendabot to leave the channel, dismiss it:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, bye</pre>

    <h3 id=help>Built-in manual</h3>

    <p>Agendabot also knows a help command and replies to it with some
      info about itself:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, help</pre>

    <p>Or you can get information about a specific command:

    <pre class=command>agendabot, help find
agendabot, help suggest
agendabot, help bye</pre>

    <h3>Slow?</h3>

    <p>Agendabot may appear to be slow. Occasionally that may be
      because the Web server is slow to deliver the requested agenda,
      but most likely you are seeing the so-called flood
      protection. The 'bot pauses before every line, to avoid being
      kicked off the channel for sending too much text in too short a
      time.

    <p>Just be patient…


<h2>Agenda formats</h2>

<p>When given a URL, agendabot tries to retrieve the document at that
URL and scan it for text that looks like an agenda. Agendabot
currently recognizes agendas in one of the following forms. The
document may be plain text, XHTML, HTML or HTML5, or any text format
that is close to plain text.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In this format, agenda topics are lines that start with a number
and a period (or some other character) and are followed by a line
starting with at least four dashes. E.g.:

<pre class=command>1. Welcome
----------

2. The apple tree
----------

3. AOB
------</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre class=example>clear agenda
agenda+ Welcome
agenda+ The apple tree
agenda+ AOB</pre>

<li>
<p>This format requires the text ‘=== AGENDA ===’ (upper- or lowercase
and possibly with more ‘=’ signs) to occur in the document. All agenda
topics are lines that start with ‘Topic:’;. E.g.:

<pre class=command>==== AGENDA ====

Topic: AOB?

Topic: Radar</pre>

<p>The word ‘AGENDA’ may also be underlined with dashes:

<pre class=command>Agenda
------
Topic: AOB?
Topic: Radar</pre>

<p>or, if the agenda is in an
  HTML file, it may be an &lt;h3&gt; element:

<pre class=command>&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic: AOB?
&lt;p&gt;Topic: Radar</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre class=example>clear agenda
agenda+ AOB?
agenda+ Radar</pre>

<li>
<p>This format already uses Zakim's format, i.e., topics are lines
that start with "agenda+". E.g.:

<pre class=command>agenda+ Roundtable
agenda+ TPAC registration
agenda+ Next meeting</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre>clear agenda
agenda+ Roundtable
agenda+ TPAC registration
agenda+ Next meeting</pre>

<li>
<p>This format has the word "Agenda" somewhere in the text and topics
are lines that start with "1)", "1.", "*", "•", "◦" or "⁃". If there
are multiple markers in use, only the one with the smallest indent is
used. The others are assumed to mark subtopics.

<pre class=command>Agenda telcon 20 July
0. Extra agenda items and other digressions
1. [css-display] Blockifications
   * Positioning
   * Syntax
2. [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration</pre>

<p>Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The
above results in the following agenda:

<pre class=example>clear agenda
agenda+ Extra agenda items and other digressions
agenda+ [css-display] Blockifications
agenda+ [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration</pre>

</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This was a 2018 Geek Week project. The idea for agendabot is due to
Richard Ishida.

      <p>During Geek Week 2020, agendabot was extended to search for
      agendas or agenda topics on its own in mailing lists.

<p>In November 2021, Richard Ishida suggested to also search in W3C
group calendars, since the calendar system had just been extended with
an editor to include agendas in events.
